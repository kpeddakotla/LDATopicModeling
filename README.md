# 📄 PDF LDA Topic Modeling Tool

The **PDF LDA Topic Modeling Tool** is a Python-based web application designed to analyze collections of academic papers (in PDF format) and extract meaningful topics using **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**. This tool provides insights into the underlying themes within documents and visualizes trends across topics. 🚀

## 🌟 Features

### ✅ **Working Features**
- **📁 Upload ZIP of PDFs**: Users can upload a `.zip` file containing multiple PDFs for analysis.
- **🎯 Customizable Topic Modeling**:
  - Specify the number of topics to generate.
  - Customize the number of words per topic.
- **🛠️ Stopword Integration**:
  - Uses default English stopwords.
  - Allows users to specify additional stopwords.
- **📜 Bibliography Skipping**: Option to skip bibliography sections in PDFs during analysis.
- **📊 LDA Model with Scikit-Learn**: Implements LDA to identify topics and extract relevant terms.

### ❌ **Not Working**
- **📊 Topic Visualization**:
  - Currently does not correctly generate a chart visualizing topics and trends over time.
- **📅 Year-Based Trend Visualization**:
  - Currently does not correctly correlate topics with decades from the documents.
- **⚠️ Error Handling for Incorrect Inputs**:
  - Insufficient validation for improperly formatted ZIP files (e.g., missing PDFs).

### 🔜 **Planned Features**
- **📅 Improved Year Extraction**:
  - Extract publication years from metadata or document text for trend analysis.
- **📄 Better PDF Parsing**:
  - Support for a wider variety of PDF formats (e.g., scanned PDFs using OCR).
- **📈 Interactive Visualizations**:
  - Enable users to interact with topic charts for deeper insights.
- **🌍 Multi-Language Support**:
  - Add support for stopwords and analysis in other languages.
- **📤 Export Results**:
  - Allow users to download topics and visualizations as files (CSV, PNG, etc.).
- **⏱️ Real-Time Analysis Progress**:
  - Display progress during the analysis for better user experience.
- **⚙️ Advanced Preprocessing Options**:
  - Enable users to customize tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization settings.
